            <h2 id="blog">Fall 2023</h2>
            <p>
              First of all, I am glad to be able to live to this Fall 2023. <br>
              Summer was crazy for I entered end-stage heart failure and had to have a heart transplant to live. <br>
              I began this new life with my thesis proposal, telling the world and my committee members on 
              everything I had done in my previous life, and what I will do in my new life. Details and the slides <a href="./thesisproposal.html" target="_blank">here.</a> <br><br>
              Hit me up if there's anything interesting to you that you want to talk about or collaborate! <br><br>

              <u>Do you Hear the People Sing? Comparison of Synchronized URL and Narrative Themes in 2020 and 2023 French Protests</u><br>
              This is a special piece. It was conceptualized, ran computationally, and written all while I was waiting in the hospital for a heart. It was accepted just a few days post-transplant and published soon after, even before I had the ability to walk beyond the house. I meant it to be the last piece I put out in the world, if it comes to that. But it looks like I will be putting out more stories for all of you to read. <br>
              In this piece, we studied the differences in synchronization, and therefore, coordination between URL and narratives within the french protests of two eras. <br>

              <u>It Takes Two to Negotiate: Modeling Social Exchange in Online Multiplayer Games</u><br>
              This piece was done in collaboration with the amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/feedkoko" target="_blank">Kokil Jaidka</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hansinahuja" target="_blank">Hansin Ahuja</a>. 
              It is accepted into CSCW 2024.<br><br>
              It describes our approach to annotating the <a href="https://github.com/kj2013/claff-diplomacy" target="_blank">Shared Task on Diplomacy</a>, a part of the AffCon Workshop in AAAI2021.<br>
              Within this, we characterize negotiation strategies with linguistic features, trustworthiness and predicting their success in the game. <br><br>

              <u>Tracking Chinaâ€™s Cross-Strait Bot Networks Against Taiwan. </u>
              This piece was done in collaboration with my bestie Charity Jacobs <a href="https://charityking2358.github.io" target="_blank"></a> who never fails to feed me soup and korean food when I'm sick<br>
              It was accepted into SBP-Brims 2024.<br>
              We found cool social media bot communities, made of Repeater Bots and Amplifier Bots (Core, Peripheral) that use influence tactics to spread propaganda regarding China/Taiwan <br>

              <u>Recruitment promotion via Twitter: A network-centric approach of analyzing community engagement using social identity.</u><br>
              This piece was done in collaboration with the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MfSABxQAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Iain Cruickshank</a> who adopted me when he was a senior and me a fresh PhD student, and never gave up on me since.
              It was accepted into ACM Digital Government and Practice. <br>
              We parse the user names and descriptions of Twitter users and grab out their identities, then profile which identity type is likely to retweet certain themes, in a measure of how effective recruitment is.
